# Gotcha! How to Write Software Tests to Improve Code Quality

## About

Software testing is the process of verifying and validating that code works as expected. The most granular level is unit testing, where each standalone unit in a code (e.g., function) is exercised to help ensure that it works correctly, even in edge and corner cases. Whether you write unit tests after your code is written or as you go, software tools exist to help make the testing process less manual and more systematic.

This workshop covers some best practices for testing code and gives participants a hands-on introduction to testing frameworks for interpreted (Python) with suggestions for compiled languages (C/C++). Though the emphasis will be on unit testing, other forms of testing such as system tests, integration tests, and regression tests will be discussed.

## Setup

Choose one of the methods below to setup the needed software for this workshop:

#### Adroit

If you already have an account on [Adroit](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems/adroit):

```bash
$ ssh <YourNetID>@adroit.princeton.edu  # VPN required if off-campus
# answer yes if prompted
$ source /scratch/environments/shared_venv/bin/activate
$ git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/software_testing.git
$ cd software_testing/02_pytest
$ python status.py
Success!
```

If you are using a **Windows** machine and you encounter `Corrupted MAC on input` then use:

```
$ ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 <YourNetID>@adroit.princeton.edu
```

#### Your Laptop

You will need to install the Python packages `pytest`, `pytest-mock`, `flask` and `requests`. It would be best to install these into an isolated software environment (see the `conda create` line for Nobel below). Here is one way to install the packages:

```
$ python3 -m venv test-env
$ source test-env/bin/activate
$ pip3 install pytest pytest-mock flask requests
```

Then test your software environment:

```
(test-env) $ git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/software_testing.git
(test-env) $ cd software_testing/02_pytest
(test-env) $ python status.py
Success!
```

#### Nobel

All members of Princeton with a NetID have access to [Nobel](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems/nobel).

```bash
$ ssh <YourNetID>@nobel.princeton.edu  # VPN required if off-campus
# answer yes if prompted
$ module load anaconda3/2024.6
$ conda create --name testing-env pytest pytest-mock flask requests -c conda-forge -y
$ conda activate testing-env
$ git clone https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/software_testing.git
$ cd software_testing/02_pytest
$ python status.py
Success!
```

If you are using a **Windows** machine and you encounter `Corrupted MAC on input` then use:

```
$ ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 <YourNetID>@nobel.princeton.edu
```
